# 0.0.0.0/0
This does not mean “any IP in the subnet.”
Instead, it means “any IPv4 address in the world, no matter where it is.”
In routing terms, it’s a default route — if the destination 
IP doesn’t match a more specific rule, send it this way.

🔹 Public Subnet vs. Internet

A public subnet in AWS is just a subnet that has a route to the internet gateway.

By adding 0.0.0.0/0 → internet_gateway, you’re saying:
“Anything trying to leave my VPC, to any IP on the internet, should go through the internet gateway.”

🔹 Example
Suppose you have an EC2 instance in a public subnet.
If that EC2 tries to connect to:
8.8.8.8 (Google DNS) → matches 0.0.0.0/0, goes out to internet via IGW.
142.250.190.78 (Google.com) → also matches, goes out to internet via IGW.
So, the route applies to any IP on the internet, not just inside your subnet.
